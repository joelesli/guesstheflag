# Guess the Flag

This application was built following the SwiftUI tutorial of [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/), specifically

* [Day 20 – Project 2, part one](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20)
* [Day 21 – Project 2, part two](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/21)
* [Day 22 – Project 2, part three](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22)


Again, impressive what can be done with less than 100 lines of code.

Includes the [Challenge for day 34](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/34) in [Animation: Wrap up](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/animation-wrap-up)

1. When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
2. Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
