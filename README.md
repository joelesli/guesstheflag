This application was built following the SwiftUI tutorial of [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/), specifically

[Day 20 – Project 2, part one](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20)
[Day 21 – Project 2, part two](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/21)
[Day 22 – Project 2, part three](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22)


Again, impressive what can be done with less than 100 lines of code.
